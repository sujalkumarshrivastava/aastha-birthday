      <h3>Brown was never my favorite color—until I saw it resting in your eyes. <br>
        Black felt too dark to love—until your cloudy hair taught it how to shine. <br>
        I used to turn away from harsh white sunlight—until your silvery glow made it feel soft. <br>
        I once lived focused on my work—until your smile quietly became my favorite distraction <br>
        If beauty had a habit, <br>
        it would be distracting people exactly the way you distract me....</h3>
